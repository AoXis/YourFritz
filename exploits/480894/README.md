Timeline:

2016-06-14 14:55 - Vendor notified by (encrypted) e-mail to security@avm.de, there was no proof-of-concept exploit, only a verbal description of the (possible) threat (or an idea, how to construct such a threat), which could make it possible (amongst other attacks to DSL devices) to gain root access to a DOCSIS device.

2016-06-16 16:01 - Vendor replied, that the notification was received and the findings will be checked now.

2016-07-12 15:58 - Vendor replied, that the possible threat is still under investigation and I'll get notified, if any news make
this necessary.

2016-07-15 02:22 - Vendor notified, that the new deadline for this incident was set to 2016-07-26 (two weeks extended from the
first one).

2016-07-27 15:00 - No further contact/message from the vendor, so there's no reason to delay publishing this finding furthermore.
