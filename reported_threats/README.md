## Threats reported to AVM

This folder contains security flaws, I've reported to the vendor. 

Some of them are older and I got a bug-bounty reward for my reports - these findings are only listed, not described in detail and
I don't have any influence on publishing detailed information on them.

Some are newer and for a limited time AVM assigned incident numbers to my reports - if I've got such a number, it will be used as
folder name here. The two newest reports (as of 2016-10-21) didn't get such an assignment from AVM.

There were some other findings (from 06/2013 to 12/2014), which were reported/mentioned during phone calls only ... the 
"S44-hostname" command injection or the attack using a malformed user name for (denied) FTP login to gain a root shell are 
examples of these findings. They were never reported in written form, so I don't have correct information in my mail archive, 
when they were reported exactly and so I left them off here.
